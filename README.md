# Assignment_11_User_Information_Application

## About the app

A Node.js application that shows the basics of a user management system. Using a JSON file called 'users.json', it is possible to:
- search for existing users
- add new users to your users file

Everytime a user enters a key, it will make an AJAX call that populates the search results, and these requests happen at most once every 300 milliseconds
