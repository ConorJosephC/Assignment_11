# Assignment_11

List of changes since the  first submission:

- All unnecessary opening <form> tags have been removed.
- Links are placed inside the <head> tags.
- Scripts are located above the </body> tag and are in the right order.
- No more zipped files.
- After part 1 of the assignment (autocomplete) was uploaded, a new branch was created for part 2 (bandwidth optimization), the new files were uploaded, pull request made and the branch was successfully merged with the original.
- Autocomplete has been added to the 'no_match' page, so if your search for a user is unsuccessful after hitting the submit button, the search bar in the new page will also autocomplete.
